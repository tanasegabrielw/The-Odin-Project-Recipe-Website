This is a small HTML project, following The Odin Project curriculum. 

The theme of the project is a simple recipe website.

In order to make the pages, I will write HTML code using basic stuff such as <a>, <h1>, <p>, <img>.

By the end of the project, I will have gained a better understanding of fundamental HTML.
